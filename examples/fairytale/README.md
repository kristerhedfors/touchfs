# Fairy Tale Generation Example

This example demonstrates using TouchFS to generate an interactive fairy tale with text and images. Follow these exact steps to create a fairy tale with automatically generated chapters and images.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Create and prepare the workspace:
```bash
# Create workspace directory
mkdir -p examples/fairytale/workdir

# Mount TouchFS on the workspace
touchfs mount examples/fairytale/workdir

# Copy the prompt file to workspace
cp examples/fairytale/.prompt examples/fairytale/workdir/
```

2. Generate the fairy tale chapters in sequence:
```bash
cd examples/fairytale/workdir

# Create first chapter - Its name (minus prefix and .md) will be the story's title
touch "1. The Silicon Witch's Garden.md"

# Create subsequent chapters
touch "2. The Digital Seeds.md"
touch "3. The Binary Bloom.md"
touch "4. The Quantum Harvest.md"
touch "5. The Enchanted Repository.md"
```

3. Generate all images referenced in the chapters:
```bash
# The images will be automatically created when referenced in the markdown files
# For example, if a chapter contains:
#   ```bash
#   # Initialize chapter images
#   touch garden_interface.jpg  # A mystical garden where flowers bloom with digital patterns
#   ```
# TouchFS will generate this image using DALL-E based on the description
```

4. Preserve the generated story:
```bash
# Create directory named after first chapter (excluding "1. " prefix and .md extension)
cd ..
STORY_DIR="The Silicon Witch's Garden"
mkdir "$STORY_DIR"

# Copy all generated content
cp workdir/*.md workdir/*.jpg "$STORY_DIR/"
```

5. Unmount when finished:
```bash
touchfs mount -u workdir
```

## Expected Result

The example directory will contain:
- A story directory (e.g., "The Silicon Witch's Garden") containing:
  - All generated chapter markdown files
  - All generated images
  - Content preserved exactly as generated by TouchFS

The story's directory name comes directly from the first chapter's title, maintaining the creative context established by TouchFS.
